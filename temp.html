                        <em>An action camera or action-cam is a digital camera designed for recording action while 
                        being immersed in it. Action cameras are therefore typically compact and rugged, and 
                        waterproof at surface-level. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        They typically record photos in burst mode and time-lapse 
                        mode with the point of view of the shooter they capture video in 4 k mode as this 
                        allows continuous capture of the action without having to interact with the camera or 
                        indeed removing it from its housing, if an additional protective housing is used.
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                        Most record on a micro SD card, and have a Micro-USB connector.</em></p>

                    <div><p>Of course any time an outdoor sport is involved you 
                            need something that can brave the harsh elements and not have to worry about it 
                            breaking or malfunctioning. The best action cameras are made with a durable 
                            plastic. Also, a protective case comes standard with most action cameras.</p></div>
                    <div class="center"><h3><strong>Can go where other cameras cannot</strong></h3></div>
                    <div><p>Often timeâ€™s cameras are 
                            big, bulky, and expensive which prevents the ease of taking them to certain 
                            spots. On the other hand, action cameras are a lot smaller and can easily fit or 
                            be mounted where most cameras cannot.</p></div>
